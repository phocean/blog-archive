			<p>The other day I was shocked to find this entry in my Apache logs:</p>
<pre>[error] SSL Library Error: 336068931 error:14080143:SSL routines:SSL3_ACCEPT:unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled</pre>
<p>It occurs appears when I try to use a SSL client certificate with Safari. Of course, authentication is broken as it just fails on an 403 error page.</p>
<p>So it seems that Safari is the last browser which was not patched against <a href="../../../2009/11/28/openssl-cve-2009-3555-security-fix-and-mod_ssl-client-authentication-breakage.html">CVE-2009-3555</a> !</p>
<p>2009 !! At least, I quickly checked the other browsers I had around and they were fine: IE, Firefox, Chrome&#8230; I am having an issue with Opera also, but although I have not identified the problem yet, it seems unrelated (and does not throw the same error).</p>
<p>Note that I reported the issue to Apple, but I did not receive any answer. Silence on the wire.</p>

			<h2>Linux desktop is in bad shape&#8230;</h2>
<p>The culprits? Unity and Gnome 3. I am not talking about KDE, as I never felt good with it. I had tried KDE 4 and it did not change my opinion, not to mention that I suffered from several bugs.</p>
<p>Unity? Like many people, I just don&#8217;t get it. It is pretty clumsy and feels unachieved. I also suffered from a lot of performance issues like <a title="Unity lag" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/764330" target="_blank">this</a> that are never fixed and make it a pain to use daily.<br />
Gnome 3? Actually, I liked it. It looks nice, is pretty fast and smooth. What I like the most is the workflow. It really makes use of workspaces logical and optimum. But&#8230; it did not work for me! Instability, <a title="Gnome 3 VMWare hang" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/869408" target="_blank">again</a> and <a title="Gnome 3 and ATI" href="http://ati.cchtml.com/show_bug.cgi?id=99" target="_blank">again</a>.<br />
You will tell me, that I should have stayed with Gnome 2 or go to XFCE / Openbox / etc. I have used all of them. They have qualities, sure, but we are in 2012 and I want something with more features.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: it is sad that after so many years, Linux is not yet ready for the desktop, because some guys decided to break everything again instead of doing incremental enhancements. Why breaking so suddenly things that work? I don&#8217;t get it. I felt really fustrated with the feeling that I was at the same point as 5 years ago, dealing with the same kind of bugs. I have long been a Linux advocate and I believed I was right a few years back when I told people it was promising and superior to the competition (Windows XP at the time). Now years have passed, and I started to feel I was lying, or hiding the truth that is Linux Desktop failed and went nowhere.<br />
Yes, I just got tired to fight with the computer to get basic things done. And considering the <a title="Linus Thorvalds on Gnome 3" href="https://plus.google.com/102150693225130002912/posts/UkoAaLDpF4i" target="_blank">Linus post</a> and several reactions into the comments, I am not alone in this case.</p>
<h2>&#8230; so I gave a try to Apple&#8230;</h2>
<p>I recently got a Mac Book Pro. The main reason is I wanted a very stable workstation to focus on my work. It was hard to admit after so many years using it, but I came to the conclusion that a Linux desktop could not meet this requirement anymore.</p>
<p>So I am going to be with Mac OS Lion for a while (though I am certainly not closing the door to the Linux desktop forever). I have to say that it is a nice OS and it is damned stable. It is good to have something that works out of the box, without any frustration or need to customize things to have something suitable.</p>
<p>And what about the stability of Mac OS? It is very eye candy, but is it stable?</p>
<p>At first, I actually had some serious troubles. It was freezing almost every day, forcing me to a cold reboot. I started to be seriously doubtful concerning the stability of Mac OS, when I found by chance that the freeze occured every time that Sophos Antivirus started an update&#8230;</p>
<h2>Antivirus and Mac OS&#8230;</h2>
<p>Wait, what? Antivirus? On Mac OS? I know it will be the reaction of many Mac users. I do also think that it is useless, but for a different reason than most of them.<br />
Of course, I don&#8217;t get the &#8220;Mac OS is secure&#8221; marketing. Actually, it has the less secure kernel around, even though it benefits from a robust Unix architecture.<br />
No, my point is that antivirus all fail anyway. In forensic analysis, we can even not trust an antivirus scan to decide if a machine is sane or not. Instead, we have to use specific tools and memory acquisition to make sure.<br />
It is simply because signature-based detection can always be worked around by malwares. There are hundreds of ways to achieve it successfully: changing binary headers, code obfuscation, encryption, hooking (see rootkits and bootkits).<br />
Ok, antivirus vendors claim that they also offer behavioral detection, sandboxes, etc. Yes, that&#8217;s a good move, but they can&#8217;t check all of the system activity and again there are many ways to bypass it. So why bother?</p>
<p>I mean, I still think it matters to have an antivirus on Windows. Especially for people who are not too techy. At least, it will detect the most basics threats and throw out alarms. There are thousands of such threats on Windows, and on this point antivirus offer a simple way to defeat them (though awareness and education are certainly more important).</p>
<p>But on Mac Os, and on Linux as well, there are very few threats. Once again, it is not that they are so much secure, but at the time I am writing, it is a fact.</p>
<p>So to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>very few threats on Mac OS and Linux</li>
<li>antivirus still massively rely on signature-based detection</li>
</ul>
<p>You see: if there is nothing much to detect, an antivirus is overhead. It will only eat some resources and fail anyway against coming threats.<br />
Just keeping the system up-to-date is certainly the best thing to do so far.</p>
<p>Well, so why did I set an antivirus? I was actually using it for my forensic analysis on Windows machines. It was a convenient way for me to have a local scanner that I could started on dumped suspicious processes, without having to connect on Viruscan. It used to be convenient when I was traveling without connection, but I can live without it.</p>
<h2>About Sophos for Mac OS</h2>
<p>So moreover this piece of software was crashing my laptop. The update part seems to be executed with root privileges, and for some reason it locks the system (not only mine, <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Version-8-s-AutoUpdate-consistently-CRASHING/td-p/5957o29DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa-t6bKUNhGqDIdvtkicGvsdvMmg" target="_blank">look</a> <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Sophos-AV-7-3-8C-Crashed-MacBook-Pro-AGAIN-Unacceptable-Software/td-p/5397" target="_blank">at</a> <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Given-up-temporarily-on-Sophos-for-Mac/td-p/3703" target="_blank">the</a> forums). Not to mention that having such a component may offer more room to malicious code to exploit the kernel&#8230;</p>
<p>A shame, a pure piece of crap. Now that I removed it, I am enjoying an uptime of about 30 days!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1235" title="Sophos Antivirus for Mac OS: a piece of crap" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1086d0317ba5fbde3728edad856d5744.js" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sophos Antivirus for Mac OS is pure crap, run to remove it if it happens to be on your computer.</p>
<p>Anyway, you don&#8217;t need an antivirus on Mac OS. Moreover, it seems that several vendor offer solution that lack of maturity and testing on this platform. So you would actually degrade your system stability and security if you would installed on of these.</p>
<p>And Mac OS is a nice Unix-based desktop alternative to have the work done, even though sadly it is not open-source.</p>

			<p>By default, access from openSUSE or any Linux box,to a Windows Vista CIFS share is broken.<br />
The cause is that Samba speaks NTLM while Vista speaks only NTLMv2.</p>
<p><a title="Vista and Samba share" href="http://forum.soft32.com/windows/Connecting-Linux-samba-share-Vista-ftopict345337.html">Googling</a> provided the solution, but it does not seems well known yet.</p>
<p>A workaround is to make Vista more flexible on client acceptation.</p>
<p>If you are running the Ultimate or Buisness version of Vista :</p>
<ul>
<li>Run secpol.msc</li>
<li>Go to <em>Local Policies / Security Options</em></li>
<li>Find <em>Network Security : LAN Manager authentication level</em></li>
<li>Change the setting from <em>Send NTLMv2 response only</em> to <em>Send LM &amp; NTLM &#8211; use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running the Home version, you will have to edit the registry manually :</p>
<p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\LMCompatibilityLevel</em></p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t already exist, create a <em>DWORD</em> value named <em>LmCompatibilityLevel</em> and set its value to 1.</p>
<p>Or in smb.conf :<br />
<code>client ntlmv2 auth = yes</code></p>
<p>More ressources <a title="NTLM" href="http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html#theNtlm2SessionResponse" target="_blank">there</a>.</p>

			<p>It had been months since I had an weired issue with the embedded audio controller of my Gigabyte motherboard.</p>
<p>Plugin the headphones on the front panel of my box didn&#8217;t mute the output to the speakers, which nullified the purpose of having headphones.</p>
<p>I long thought that it was some hardware issue that I would have to sort some day by opening the box and checking the connections.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I decided to solve it for good and I started to google&#8230; and found out that it was a pure software issue!</p>
<p>The culprit sounded to be some unproper settings of the ALSA module and this <a title="Hda Intel Sound Howto" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto">Ubuntu guide</a> just saved me.</p>
<p>I carefully followed the steps and it appeared that for my <a title="Gigabyte GA-790FXTA-UD5" href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3258" target="_blank">Gigabyte GA-790FXTA-UD5</a>, it was necessary to this line:</p>
<pre>add ﻿options snd-hda-intel model=3stack-hp</pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</pre>
<p>Ok, it did not go so smoothly as I picked out randomly models from the list until I find the right one (I had no idea of what was embbeded on my board). I hope this may help, as I have quite a lot of people with similar issues with all kinds of vendors.</p>

			<h2>The virtualization buzz</h2>
<p>I have recently worked on network virtualization. Many people, especially the network guys, have been recently excited with the VMware Vswitch or Cisco Nexus stuff.  It is something that I understand because virtualization is cool. It brings many convenient features that truly make the life easier.</p>
<p>But what about the security? Convenience and security rarely come together, right? Oh, wait&#8230; we are in 2011, so lessons must have been learned. After all, Mr Salesman swear that it is more secure than ever. Convenience and security packed together, he says&#8230; it sounds promising. Let&#8217;s dig a little to find out what they won&#8217;t tell you&#8230;</p>
<p>I will focus on what really changes with virtualization : the architecture. One of the main goals of the technology is to reduce the number of physical devices to cut the costs, save space and energy. Of course, it goes with a simplification of the <strong>physical </strong>architecture. Therefore, some features previously handled by dedicated physical devices are now handled <strong>logically by a unique piece of hardware</strong>.</p>
<p>This obviously goes against the security best practices about designing network architectures with various degrees of exposure. But has the technology evolved so much that we should reconsider these recommendations?</p>
<h2>VMware Vswitches or Nexus 1000V</h2>
<p>These technologies are similar in the sense that they are designed to work directly inside the VMware platform. Vswitches are integrated with the solution of VMware, while Nexus benefits from the experience of Cisco and bring more layer 2 control (more settings, more protocols).</p>
<p>As well on the architecture documents of VMware as within the administration interface of Vcenter, it appears so easy to create segregated switches and build this way in a few clicks a DMZ architecture:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1069" title="Vswitch" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/S%c3%a9lection_002.resized.png" alt="" width="318" height="240" /></p>
<p>But it is slightly different in reality, as <strong>Brad Hedlund</strong> from Cisco shows in an interesting article: <a title="the vswitch illusion and DMZ virtualization" href="http://bradhedlund.com/2010/02/10/vswitch-illusion-dmz-virtualization/" target="_blank">the vswitch illusion and DMZ virtualization</a>. In short, whether you are using VMware Vswitches or Nexus 1000V, a single threaded program runs all the configured virtual switches. In clear, all the virtual switches share the same memory space. So, any vulnerability in the code would compromise all the switches, in other words: the entire network. And, not a surprise here, there have been many vulnerabilities. Just browse a <a title="CVE database" href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve/" target="_blank">CVE database</a> if you want to check.</p>
<p>So you don&#8217;t want to rely on such a design for your datacenter, right?</p>
<h2>Nexus 7000</h2>
<p>In the case of the Nexus 7000, it is a little bit different because most   of the switching work is handled by specific hardware, which have a   much smaller attack surface than the vswitches stuff. But is it really   safe?</p>
<p>The Nexus family is quite new and from what I could witness, they are  quite pushy selling that. Because it is new, there is still neither much  info surrounding the technologies used, nor user feedback, nor security  research. Anyway, below is a quick sum-up of what I could find.</p>
<h3>A few words about the architecture</h3>
<p>In a layer 3 Nexus architecture, Nexus 2000, 5000 and 7000 are designed to work together. Nexus 2000 are basically top-of-the-rack port panels, with no intelligence. Nexus 5000 takes care of most of the layer 2 switching, while Nexus 7000 adds layer 2 functionalities and layer 3 support. Nexus 2000 and 5000 can work without the 7000, but in that case there is not so much difference with a classic layer 2 switch in terms of security (but it has the advantage to be more flexible to integrate in a datacenter). <a title="Difference between Nexus 7000 and Nexus 5000" href="http://www.netcraftsmen.net/resources/technical-articles/348.html" target="_blank">This</a> and <a title="Nexus 7000 architecture" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/33217473/RST-3009-Cisco-Nexus-7000-Switch-Architecture" target="_blank">this</a> may help you to visualize the differences.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1070" title="Nexus Architecture" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nexus-architecture.resized.js" /></p>
<p>So we will focus on the Nexus 7000 architecture, which bring VDC as a way to handle DMZ architectures. VDC are somehow similar to VLANs. But whereas VLANs virtualized LANs on a switch, VDC virtualize switches. So, on the same Nexus 5000 device, VDC will add the capacity to have multiple virtual switches which are in theory properly isolated.</p>
<p>This is a very basic sum-up for what we are interested in, but if you want to learn more, I encourage you to read the <a title="Cisco VDC" href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps9441/ps9402/ps9512/White_Paper_Tech_Overview_Virtual_Device_Contexts.html" target="_blank">Cisco whitepaper about VDCs</a>.</p>
<h3>The flaws</h3>
<p>Now that the presentations are made, the downside&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>George Hedfors</strong> is the only researcher that worked notably on this platform, as far as I am aware. He made some really great findings, that you can discover within <a title="NX OS Speech, George Hedfors" href="http://george.hedfors.com/content/slides-my-nx-os-speech-t2-helsinki" target="_blank">his slides</a>.<br />
At the time of his work &#8211; 2010, it appeared that the NX-OS consisted of a Linux Kernel 2.6.10 (released in 2004!). We can imagine that the OS has been signifiantly customized and hardened by Cisco. They may have include NX-bit support  (included since 2.6.8 and later improved). However, there is probably no ALSR support (2.6.12), no MAC system (SELinux or Tomoyo). Of course, I may be wrong but I haven&#8217;t found any documentation about that and my Cisco contact did not provide me with any consistent detail.</p>
<p>Anyway, he found a bunch of design flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor CLI design</strong>: there are 686 hidden commands (system, debugging) that can be launched as root (sudo without password). One of these command is gdb, which can start a network daemon as root. The attacker can then connect to the socket to attach to any process on the system to elevate his privileges. Of course, it requires some shell access, so the exposure is limited. However, it is very instructive of how the system was designed!</li>
<li><strong>Insecure daemon configuration</strong>: Daemon are not chrooted and run with the root user.</li>
<li><strong>Embarassing CDP vulnerability</strong> : a vulnerability from 2001 was reintroduced in the code handling CDP. So it is possible to crash a daemon running as root. What if another vulnerability on a layer 2 daemon (vtp, hsrp, stp&#8230;) was discovered and allowed to rewrite the stack? Game over, the attacker is root.</li>
<li><strong>Strange hidden account</strong> : there is a ftpuser hidden account with a dumb password (nbv123). Secret backdoor? I don&#8217;t know, but anyway it is not serious at all and should have been revealed by any consistent audit.</li>
<li><strong>Shell design flaw</strong>: the VSH shell accepts a parameter (-a) that allow to spawn any command over the security roles normaly in place.</li>
<li>You can also get a root shell by simply spawning <strong><em>ssh `/bin/bash`</em></strong> from the CLI.</li>
</ul>
<p>To any serious security guy or unix administrator, these should look like amateurism. And what&#8217;s the hell are all the security audits for?</p>
<p>So concerning the Nexus 7000, it is obvious that at best it is not specifically designed to be secure, at worst it was simply as poorly designed (or released too quickly) as most stuff.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, one thing we can tell for sure is that none of the virtualized networking solutions are designed to be secure. Of course, all these flaws are hopefully already or will be soon fixed. But, despite what Cisco may claim, the facts are here: there is no VDC miracle. The Nexus platform is certainly great, but not more bug-free, flaw-free than any other piece of code.<br />
No virtualized architecture can give the same degree of protection than physical segregation.</p>
<p>In the case of Vswitches or Nexus 1000, the attack surface is just too high to use it for DMZ segregation if you are serious about security. The vulnerabilities are already here and it will be feasible for a skillful and motivated attacker to own your datacenter.</p>
<p>Concerning the Nexus 7000 and its VDC, the attack surface is considerably reduced because there is less code and fewer protocols at layer 2. However, it is undoubtly less secure than physical segregation. Any zero-day vulnerability would potentially expose the datacenter (and we all know that some zero-day sometimes take years before coming to the public, which is a lot of time for the criminals or the government agencies to exploit it). You can&#8217;t take it lightly when it comes to the whole datacenter integrity and it doesn&#8217;t make sense if you have expensive (in cash or in labor hours) security at upper layers.</p>
<p>But, of course, it may depend on what you have to protect. If your datacenter hosts sensitive data for your company&#8217;s buisiness, then you should think twice on how you deploy virtualization or use the cloud.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. These technologies are great and very useful. In many areas, there are an improvement. Simply, they must be used with as much care as always. Concerning the DMZ topic, as far as I am concerned, I will not rely on virtualization and keep physical segregation between zones, supported by different  devices from different makers.</p>
<p>One thing I keep an eye on, though, is the development of virtualized firewalls, IPS, etc. In a few years, if these technologies should became really mature (enforcing segregation on all OSI layers) and the hosting OS security should really improved, most of the concerns here would be addressed.</p>

			<p>We all know that passwords sucks, that they are the nightmare of all administrators and security guys. So many hacks have been eased because the victims reused the same password everywhere : email account, forum, bank, critical systems&#8230;</p>
<p>Sadly, so far, there is even not the beginning of a replacement solution. Passwords will be there for long, so we would better use them accordingly.</p>
<p>Yes, I am aware of many on-line services like FisrtPass, KeePass, 1stPassword, etc. However, I don&#8217;t feel comfortable with having all my password somewhere on-line, even if they claim &#8211; and I believe they are sincere, that they use strong encryption and can&#8217;t access to it.</p>
<p>Instead, I use a combination of the Firefox password manager and the <a title="Pwgen for Firefox" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/pwgen-password-generator/" target="_blank">Pwgen add-on</a>. I use this add-on to quickly and conveniently generate a random password when I subscribe to a web service. When Firefox prompts for it, I just choose to remember the password automatically. SSO quick and dirty.</p>
<p>For the other passwords that I can&#8217;t and don&#8217;t need to memorize, I store them in a local encrypted file.</p>
<p>To edit the file, I simply use Vim with this nice <a title="GPG Vim plugin" href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Edit_gpg_encrypted_files" target="_blank">GPG plugin</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy gpg.vim to /home/$user/.vim/plugin</li>
<li>if not done yet, generate you GPG key :
<pre> $ gpg --gen-key</pre>
</li>
<li>Encrypt your password file and erase it:
<pre>$ gpg --encrypt --recipient 'your name' passwords
$ rm passwords</pre>
</li>
<li>Now, it&#8217;s done. Just edit password.gpg to decrypt and access to your passwords (you will be prompted for your passphrase):
<pre>$ vim passwords.gpg</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the overhead of GPG, a more straightforward solution is to use the <a title="OpenSSL Vim extension" href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2012" target="_blank">OpenSSL extension</a> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the openssl.vim file to /home/$user/.vim/plugin as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Now, to encrypt to file to, say, AES (note the .aes file extension which makes sense for the plugin):
<pre>$ openssl aes-256-cbc -in passwords -out passwords.aes</pre>
</li>
<li>Decryption will occur as soon as you edit the file with Vim:
<pre>$ vim passwords.aes</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that, if not perfect, it is pretty secure. I mean not more, not less than your system is. Anyway I don&#8217;t have any need for an on-line manager. And you, how do you manage your passwords? Let us know about your tips.</p>
