				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!--StartFragment-->It happened to me a little more complex than expected, so I thought it would deserve a post. There are a few <a href="http://www.darkoperator.com/installing-metasploit-in-ubunt/">good</a> <a href="http://briancanfixit.blogspot.fr/2011/12/setting-up-metasploit-and-armitage-on.html">tutorials</a> already, but they actually did not work flawlessly for me. So while this post is mostly based on them, there are some slight differences.</p>
<h1>Getting Metasploit</h1>
<p>First, let&#8217;s fetch Metasploit. Adjust the last two lines by replacing <code>.zshrc</code> (I am using Zsh) with <code>.bash_profile</code> if you are using Bash, for instance.</p>
<p>This will download, create symlinks and set the database settings path (we will come back on it later) in your environment:</p>
<pre>cd /usr/local/share/
git clone https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework.git
cd metasploit-framework
for MSF in $(ls msf*); do ln -s /usr/local/share/metasploit-framework/$MSF /usr/local/bin/$MSF;done
ln -s /usr/local/share/metasploit-framework/armitage /usr/local/bin/armitage
echo export MSF_DATABASE_CONFIG=/usr/local/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc</pre>
<p>Metasploit is almost ready, but don&#8217;t run anything yet. There a still quite a few steps&#8230;</p>
<h1>Getting Postgres</h1>
<p>We use Homebrew:</p>
<pre>brew install postgresql --without-ossp-build</pre>
<p>Initialization stuff:</p>
<pre>initdb /usr/local/var/postgres</pre>
<p>To have launchd start postgresql at login:</p>
<pre>ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents</pre>
<p>But I prefer to keep my startup clean, so I added two aliases in my <code>.zshrc</code></p>
<pre>alias pg_start='pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start'
alias pg_stop='pg_ctl stop'</pre>
<p>So you now have two commands, <code>pg_start</code> and <code>pg_stop</code>, to use for Metasploit.<br />
Finally, we create the msf user that will connect to the database from within Metasploit:</p>
<pre><code>createuser msf -P -h localhost  
createdb -O msf msf -h localhost </code></pre>
<p>While we are at the database stuff, let&#8217;s configure Metasploit to use it. Create a <code>database.yml</code> file in  <code>/usr/local/share/metasploit-framework/config/</code> and put these lines:</p>
<pre>production:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: msf
    username: msf
    password: &lt;password&gt;
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
    pool: 75
    timeout: 5</pre>
<p>The database is ready!</p>
<h1>Getting Ruby</h1>
<p>The last big step is to install Ruby. The one provided by Mac Os is a little too old, and you don&#8217;t want to mess with system libraries, so let&#8217;s leave it untouched. You could install Ruby with Homebrew, but it happens that the latest version (2.0.0-p0) is not working with Metasploit (OpenSSL libraries conflicts). So we need to use something like the 1.9.3 version of Ruby.</p>
<p>Anyway, a good practice is to have some flexibility on the version you are going to use, so you would be able to switch between 1.9.3, 2.0.0 or whatever and that whenever you need.</p>
<p>Here comes <strong>rbenv</strong>. For the next steps, I will assume that you have a working homebrew setting.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go:</p>
<pre>brew install rbenv ruby-build</pre>
<p>Add this line to your .zshrc or bash_profile:</p>
<pre>eval "$(rbenv init -)"</pre>
<p>Now you should be able to list all installable versions of Ruby:</p>
<pre>rbenv install --list</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s pick up 1.9.3:</p>
<pre>rbenv install 1.9.3-p392</pre>
<p>It takes a while, but after it is completed, you can set it as your default:</p>
<pre>rbenv rehash
rbenv global 1.9.3-p392</pre>
<p>Note that you could use the <code>local</code> command instead of <code>global</code> to set it for the current terminal only.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s check that everything is correctly set. This is where the Ruby versions are stored:</p>
<pre>$ ls ~/.rbenv/versions/
1.9.3-p392 2.0.0-p0</pre>
<p><code>ruby</code> and <code>gem</code> MUST point to the 1.9.3 version:</p>
<pre>$ rbenv which ruby
$HOME/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p392/bin/ruby
$ rbenv which gem
$HOME/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p392/bin/gem</pre>
<p>Looks good, let&#8217;s go ahead.</p>
<p>We are now able to install up the required gems for Metasploit. They made it easy by packaging these in a Gemfile that can be read by the &#8220;bundle&#8221; utility:</p>
<pre>gem install bundle
cd /usr/local/share/metasploit-framework
rbenv rehash
bundle install</pre>
<h1>Final steps</h1>
<p>Create an <code>vncviewer</code> wrapper to facilitate use from within Metasploit:</p>
<pre>echo '#!/usr/bin/env bash'  &gt;&gt; /usr/local/bin/vncviewer   
echo open vnc://\$1 &gt;&gt; /usr/local/bin/vncviewer  
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vncviewer</pre>
<p>Get and compile the pcaprub library (optional):</p>
<pre>cd /usr/local/share/metasploit-framework/external
git clone <a href="http://github.com/shadowbq/pcaprub.git">http://github.com/shadowbq/pcaprub.git</a>
cd ./ext/pcaprub
ruby extconf.rb &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</pre>
<h1>Have fun!</h1>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t, don&#8217;t forget to start Postgres, and you are ready to play:</p>
<pre>sudo -E msfconsole</pre>
<p>It should deploy the database structure and then start to work without warning. Hurrah! That was not hard, but a bit long, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>In case it still fails for you, it means that something went wrong with the setup. Check the steps again, and then leave a comment as it may be the time for an update or a correction of this article.</p>
<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>As stated in the introduction, this article is mostly taken from <a href="http://www.darkoperator.com/installing-metasploit-in-ubunt/">darkoperator.com</a> with minor adjustments (it actually did not work out of the box for me), so the use of rbenv. I hope it will be helpful to other people in the same case as me.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE 09/07/2013</strong>:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>change in pcaprub directory (./pcaprub &#8211;&gt; ./ext/pcaprub)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE 07/23/2013</strong>:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">add missing </span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">rbenv rehash command (thanks @</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">amukofes)</span></em></li>
<li><em>add missing commands to retrieve pcaprub (thanks @Ton)</em></li>

<p>Meanwhile, I had received a laconic answer from Apple to my bug report saying that they &#8220;are aware of this issue&#8221;.</p>
<p>Note that Safari 6.0 on Lion <a href="/2012/06/10/cve-2009-3555-safari-not-yet-patched.html">did not</a> (at least on my computer, if someone could confirm)&#8230; so same browser version, different OS, the system SSL library must have been &#8211; silently &#8211; updated.</p>
<p>Anyway, good move finally.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, thanks for all the comments in the previous articles (<a title="Rootkit in my lab ? (part I)" href="/2012/06/30/rootkit-in-my-lab.html">Part I</a> and <a title="Rootkit in my lab ? (part II)" href="/2012/07/11/rootkit-in-my-lab-part-ii.html">Part II</a>).</p>
<p>I decided to analyze one the crash I experienced during registry analysis.<br />
I could reproduce all the time a BSOD with Regshot. I thought it would be nice to see what I could get with WinDBG.</p>
<p>I had my environment set up with the suspicious VM configured to debug activated on the serial port, which is a simple pipe on Mac OS X.<br />
Another VM is configured with a serial port as the other end of this pipe, and WinDBG attached to it.<br />
Another method would be to just configure Windows to create a crashdump file with kernel symbols, that you can later load into WinDBG. Of course, the first method offers more opportunities to check and play with the live system.</p>
<p>Then, I just boot the target and trigger the crash, simply by starting a scan with Regshot:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/46157626" frameborder="0" width="500" height="281"></iframe></p>
<p>Windows then crashes, WinDBG catches the exception and stops.</p>
<p>So what do we have ?</p>
<p>First, the error type, <em><strong>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)</strong></em>, means that an instruction pointed to an invalid memory address. Let&#8217;s check this.</p>
<p>With <em><strong>!analyse -v</strong></em>, you get the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/regshot-BSOD.txt">full error dump</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_1331" style="width: 727px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-2.png" rel="lightbox[1317]"><img class=" wp-image-1331 " title="Crashing Instruction" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-2-1024x557.png" alt="" width="717" height="390" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-2-1024x557.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-2-300x163.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-2.png 1206w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crashing Instruction</p></div>
<p>It shows the function (nt!CmpGetValueKeyFromCache, offset 0x89) and the memory address where the crash was triggered.</p>
<p>The instruction at this address is:</p>
<pre>80637807 f3a5 rep movs dword ptr es:[edi],dword ptr [esi]</pre>
<p>This instruction is trying to copy 8 bytes at the address pointed by EDI.<br />
EDI has the value of <strong>0xe1285050</strong> at execution time.</p>
<p>And what do we have at this memory location ?</p>
<div id="attachment_1333" style="width: 727px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-3.png" rel="lightbox[1317]"><img class=" wp-image-1333 " title="EDI pointing to invalid memory section" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-3-1024x671.png" alt="" width="717" height="470" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-3-1024x671.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-3-300x196.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/07/WinXP-ReversingBox-3.png 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">EDI pointing to invalid memory section</p></div>
<p>Nothing indeed. Note that this corruption persists at every boot.</p>
<p>So what can we conclude?<br />
We can certainly exclude hardware failure, because it is a virtual machine and because the corruption always occur at the same memory region, even after a reboot.<br />
At least, I can now be sure that something in the kernel is definitely corrupted.</p>
<p>Could it be a rootkit trick? Still the question remains, but to me it now looks very, very suspicious. Some rootkit code, poorly written, could have sat in this non-paged memory area and been paged out, causing the BSOD. I have not much knowledge about it at this time but I am going to search on this. At least, I now have good starting point to look at.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for today, folks. I wrote it while I am still working on it, so sorry if it looks rough and incomplete. It is sort of live, thoughts are still in process.</p>
<p>Again, I am looking forward to reading your comments and suggestions. (Hopefully) there will be a part IV!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was shocked to find this entry in my Apache logs:</p>
<pre>[error] SSL Library Error: 336068931 error:14080143:SSL routines:SSL3_ACCEPT:unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled</pre>
<p>It occurs appears when I try to use a SSL client certificate with Safari. Of course, authentication is broken as it just fails on an 403 error page.</p>
<p>So it seems that Safari is the last browser which was not patched against <a href="/2009/11/28/openssl-cve-2009-3555-security-fix-and-mod_ssl-client-authentication-breakage.html">CVE-2009-3555</a> !</p>
<p>2009 !! At least, I quickly checked the other browsers I had around and they were fine: IE, Firefox, Chrome&#8230; I am having an issue with Opera also, but although I have not identified the problem yet, it seems unrelated (and does not throw the same error).</p>
<p>Note that I reported the issue to Apple, but I did not receive any answer. Silence on the wire.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Linux desktop is in bad shape&#8230;</h2>
<p>The culprits? Unity and Gnome 3. I am not talking about KDE, as I never felt good with it. I had tried KDE 4 and it did not change my opinion, not to mention that I suffered from several bugs.</p>
<p>Unity? Like many people, I just don&#8217;t get it. It is pretty clumsy and feels unachieved. I also suffered from a lot of performance issues like <a title="Unity lag" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/764330" target="_blank">this</a> that are never fixed and make it a pain to use daily.<br />
Gnome 3? Actually, I liked it. It looks nice, is pretty fast and smooth. What I like the most is the workflow. It really makes use of workspaces logical and optimum. But&#8230; it did not work for me! Instability, <a title="Gnome 3 VMWare hang" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/869408" target="_blank">again</a> and <a title="Gnome 3 and ATI" href="http://ati.cchtml.com/show_bug.cgi?id=99" target="_blank">again</a>.<br />
You will tell me, that I should have stayed with Gnome 2 or go to XFCE / Openbox / etc. I have used all of them. They have qualities, sure, but we are in 2012 and I want something with more features.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: it is sad that after so many years, Linux is not yet ready for the desktop, because some guys decided to break everything again instead of doing incremental enhancements. Why breaking so suddenly things that work? I don&#8217;t get it. I felt really fustrated with the feeling that I was at the same point as 5 years ago, dealing with the same kind of bugs. I have long been a Linux advocate and I believed I was right a few years back when I told people it was promising and superior to the competition (Windows XP at the time). Now years have passed, and I started to feel I was lying, or hiding the truth that is Linux Desktop failed and went nowhere.<br />
Yes, I just got tired to fight with the computer to get basic things done. And considering the <a title="Linus Thorvalds on Gnome 3" href="https://plus.google.com/102150693225130002912/posts/UkoAaLDpF4i" target="_blank">Linus post</a> and several reactions into the comments, I am not alone in this case.</p>
<h2>&#8230; so I gave a try to Apple&#8230;</h2>
<p>I recently got a Mac Book Pro. The main reason is I wanted a very stable workstation to focus on my work. It was hard to admit after so many years using it, but I came to the conclusion that a Linux desktop could not meet this requirement anymore.</p>
<p>So I am going to be with Mac OS Lion for a while (though I am certainly not closing the door to the Linux desktop forever). I have to say that it is a nice OS and it is damned stable. It is good to have something that works out of the box, without any frustration or need to customize things to have something suitable.</p>
<p>And what about the stability of Mac OS? It is very eye candy, but is it stable?</p>
<p>At first, I actually had some serious troubles. It was freezing almost every day, forcing me to a cold reboot. I started to be seriously doubtful concerning the stability of Mac OS, when I found by chance that the freeze occured every time that Sophos Antivirus started an update&#8230;</p>
<h2>Antivirus and Mac OS&#8230;</h2>
<p>Wait, what? Antivirus? On Mac OS? I know it will be the reaction of many Mac users. I do also think that it is useless, but for a different reason than most of them.<br />
Of course, I don&#8217;t get the &#8220;Mac OS is secure&#8221; marketing. Actually, it has the less secure kernel around, even though it benefits from a robust Unix architecture.<br />
No, my point is that antivirus all fail anyway. In forensic analysis, we can even not trust an antivirus scan to decide if a machine is sane or not. Instead, we have to use specific tools and memory acquisition to make sure.<br />
It is simply because signature-based detection can always be worked around by malwares. There are hundreds of ways to achieve it successfully: changing binary headers, code obfuscation, encryption, hooking (see rootkits and bootkits).<br />
Ok, antivirus vendors claim that they also offer behavioral detection, sandboxes, etc. Yes, that&#8217;s a good move, but they can&#8217;t check all of the system activity and again there are many ways to bypass it. So why bother?</p>
<p>I mean, I still think it matters to have an antivirus on Windows. Especially for people who are not too techy. At least, it will detect the most basics threats and throw out alarms. There are thousands of such threats on Windows, and on this point antivirus offer a simple way to defeat them (though awareness and education are certainly more important).</p>
<p>But on Mac Os, and on Linux as well, there are very few threats. Once again, it is not that they are so much secure, but at the time I am writing, it is a fact.</p>
<p>So to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>very few threats on Mac OS and Linux</li>
<li>antivirus still massively rely on signature-based detection</li>
</ul>
<p>You see: if there is nothing much to detect, an antivirus is overhead. It will only eat some resources and fail anyway against coming threats.<br />
Just keeping the system up-to-date is certainly the best thing to do so far.</p>
<p>Well, so why did I set an antivirus? I was actually using it for my forensic analysis on Windows machines. It was a convenient way for me to have a local scanner that I could started on dumped suspicious processes, without having to connect on Viruscan. It used to be convenient when I was traveling without connection, but I can live without it.</p>
<h2>About Sophos for Mac OS</h2>
<p>So moreover this piece of software was crashing my laptop. The update part seems to be executed with root privileges, and for some reason it locks the system (not only mine, <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Version-8-s-AutoUpdate-consistently-CRASHING/td-p/5957o29DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa-t6bKUNhGqDIdvtkicGvsdvMmg" target="_blank">look</a> <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Sophos-AV-7-3-8C-Crashed-MacBook-Pro-AGAIN-Unacceptable-Software/td-p/5397" target="_blank">at</a> <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Given-up-temporarily-on-Sophos-for-Mac/td-p/3703" target="_blank">the</a> forums). Not to mention that having such a component may offer more room to malicious code to exploit the kernel&#8230;</p>
<p>A shame, a pure piece of crap. Now that I removed it, I am enjoying an uptime of about 30 days!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1235" title="Sophos Antivirus for Mac OS: a piece of crap" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1086d0317ba5fbde3728edad856d5744.js" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sophos Antivirus for Mac OS is pure crap, run to remove it if it happens to be on your computer.</p>
<p>Anyway, you don&#8217;t need an antivirus on Mac OS. Moreover, it seems that several vendor offer solution that lack of maturity and testing on this platform. So you would actually degrade your system stability and security if you would installed on of these.</p>
<p>And Mac OS is a nice Unix-based desktop alternative to have the work done, even though sadly it is not open-source.</p>
