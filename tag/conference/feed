				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a long long time since my last post&#8230; I have been very busy, but hopefully I am coming back in the coming months.</p>
<p>Just a quick note to tell that I just come back from the <a title="HES 2012" href="http://2012.hackitoergosum.org/blog/schedule/schedule">Hackito Ergo Sum 2012</a> (HES).</p>
<p>And that was great. All conferences were interesting and the level was very high. We could enjoy a lot of new stuff that is going to be discussed in the community during the next months. On top of that, it was really well organized.</p>
<p>So far it is the conference that I enjoyed the most in France. Keep up the good work!</p>
