				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It had been months since I had an weired issue with the embedded audio controller of my Gigabyte motherboard.</p>
<p>Plugin the headphones on the front panel of my box didn&#8217;t mute the output to the speakers, which nullified the purpose of having headphones.</p>
<p>I long thought that it was some hardware issue that I would have to sort some day by opening the box and checking the connections.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I decided to solve it for good and I started to google&#8230; and found out that it was a pure software issue!</p>
<p>The culprit sounded to be some unproper settings of the ALSA module and this <a title="Hda Intel Sound Howto" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto">Ubuntu guide</a> just saved me.</p>
<p>I carefully followed the steps and it appeared that for my <a title="Gigabyte GA-790FXTA-UD5" href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3258" target="_blank">Gigabyte GA-790FXTA-UD5</a>, it was necessary to this line:</p>
<pre>add ﻿options snd-hda-intel model=3stack-hp</pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre>/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf</pre>
<p>Ok, it did not go so smoothly as I picked out randomly models from the list until I find the right one (I had no idea of what was embbeded on my board). I hope this may help, as I have quite a lot of people with similar issues with all kinds of vendors.</p>
