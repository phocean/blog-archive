				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230; and was quite impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday evening</strong>, I called the support to report that I was not satified with my battery. I had lost 25% of its capacity over less than 8 months.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday morning</strong>, I am recalled by someone from the technical service. They first say that the battery is no more under warranty &#8211; 1 year long. I guess they say so after checking when the battery was made or sold the retailer. That does not concern the end-consumer like me : the warranty only started when I purchased the laptop, and I still have 4 months of warranty ahead.</p>
<p>As they asked, I send them by fax the bill which proves that, <strong>thursday afternoon</strong>. Soon after, they recall me again, just to tell me that a new battery is going to be sent to me.</p>
<p><strong>Friday morning</strong>, it arrived ! So far, so good !</p>
<p>Next time, I may test it again concerning <a href="http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=AnRXhZMiAaU" target="_blank">this issue</a> (not so terrible in fact, and I am reluctant to send back my laptop).</p>
