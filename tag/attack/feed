<p>Though not many details are given, I am quite skeptical about the possibility of such a massive attack.</p>
<p>However, it shows well that security is not just a technical matter. It has many implications in law, politics, economics, and a whole information system must be prepared to that, starting with our leaders.</p>
<p>That would be a HUGE effort for our politicians here in France &#8211; if they ever care&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And Google is making so much noise about <a title="Google vs China" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/operation-aurora/">that</a> ?</p>
<p>If what is said is true, it nothing else but a trojan. A good one, but nothing new otherwise.</p>
<p>I would also say that the most targeted company was Microsoft. After all, it was an Internet Explorer 0-days breach that was exploited. Once the computer was infected, I bet that the trojan was doing much more than just targeting Gmail. To maximise the chance of an attack to succeed, a good trojan comes with a bunch of functionalities and harvest as many things as possible on the computer. Thus I doubt the target was only Google.</p>
<p>As <a title="Ballmer about Google and China" href="http://www.osnews.com/comments/22738">Steve Ballmer</a> said (hey, I didn&#8217;t think I would ever quote him here ! :D ), it happens every day. And it must not be something new in a country like China. And suddenly, Google cares ? Whereas they quietly applied censorship in China until then ? I always become suspicious when a multinational company claims it cares about human rights to the detriment of its business.</p>
<p>Maybe Google is just really wanting to get out of China for some reason (not so popular there with the competition of <a title="Baidu" href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a>?) and is looking for an excuse. More details will certainly be coming so time will tell&#8230;</p>
