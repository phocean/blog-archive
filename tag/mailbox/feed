				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I suddenly started to received some undelivered mail notifications while I was trying to send some messages to a mailbox hosted on my Postfix server.</p>
<p>The cause described in the notification was :</p>
<pre>error writing message: File too large</pre>
<p>The first thing I did was checking my configuration file,<strong> main.cf</strong>.<br />
It seemed all right :</p>
<pre>[...]
mailbox_size_limit = 0
message_size_limit = 200000000
[...]</pre>
<p>Note that &#8220;0&#8221; means unlimited.<br />
I checked the mailbox in question : it was nearing the size of 50 Mb.</p>
<p>I started to think that during some Postfix update, the meaning of the value &#8220;0&#8221; may have changed.<br />
I tried different values without success.</p>
<p>I started to become crazy with that, but, finally, after quite a long time spent on google, I finally found <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1325">the trick</a>, which is just a simple line to add in <strong>main.cf</strong> :</p>
<pre>virtual_mailbox_limit = 0</pre>
<p>Indeed, I use virtual users as mail account ! I just never imagined there was a differtent setting for virtual users (which can be a convenient setting in some case).</p>
