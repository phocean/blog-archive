				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230; and was quite impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday evening</strong>, I called the support to report that I was not satified with my battery. I had lost 25% of its capacity over less than 8 months.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday morning</strong>, I am recalled by someone from the technical service. They first say that the battery is no more under warranty &#8211; 1 year long. I guess they say so after checking when the battery was made or sold the retailer. That does not concern the end-consumer like me : the warranty only started when I purchased the laptop, and I still have 4 months of warranty ahead.</p>
<p>As they asked, I send them by fax the bill which proves that, <strong>thursday afternoon</strong>. Soon after, they recall me again, just to tell me that a new battery is going to be sent to me.</p>
<p><strong>Friday morning</strong>, it arrived ! So far, so good !</p>
<p>Next time, I may test it again concerning <a href="http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=AnRXhZMiAaU" target="_blank">this issue</a> (not so terrible in fact, and I am reluctant to send back my laptop).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a replacement of my old but reliable Vaio, I bought a Lenovo Thinkpad T61.</p>
<p><a title="T61, a nice piece of hardware" rel="attachment wp-att-98" href="/?attachment_id=98"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a title="T61, a nice piece of hardware" rel="attachment wp-att-98" href="/?attachment_id=98"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/t61.thumbnail.js" /></a></p>
<p>About laptop PC, I have always been conveiced that the best pieces of hardware are found among Sony and Lenovo (ex-IBM). In tough or ultra-light categories, I would add Panasonic, but it is not the kind of laptop I am looking for.<br />
<span id="more-97"></span><br />
So this time I am giving a try to Lenovo. What really decided me is its old fashion screen, I mean a non-bright one. My eyes are really getting tired with all these new bright laptop screens. Plus, its resolution is impressive : 1440 x 900.</p>
<p>So far I am pretty satisfied. For my need, the 14.1&#8243; screen is the best compromise, and so is the weight and size of the laptop.</p>
<p>Without surprise, the keyboard and the trackpoint are just excellent. I also aprreciate some features like the hardware encryption of the hard drive, which also benefits from the active protection (head parking in case of shock to protect the data).</p>
<p>The laptop built and design are not as nice and polished as the Sony ones, but it is certainly solid.</p>
<p>After I took it just out of the box, I thought I would give a look to the pre-installed Windows Vista system. But the first startup appeared to be so long that I quickly stopped it in the middle of its process, inserted a fresh Debian Lenny 64 bits CD and went for a set up.</p>
<p>I worked pretty well out of the box. Like usual, I had to download the Intel Wifi firmware and the proprietary nvidia driver to use all the features of my Quadro NVS  140M graphic card.</p>
<p>More annoying, the active protection is not supported by default by the kernel.</p>
<p>I also have a problem with hibernation. Suspend to RAM works well, but resuming after suspend to disk always leave me on a blank screen. I guess this is related to the graphic driver, but so far the workaround that I found from other users don&#8217;t work for me.</p>
<p>Other things, including the fingerprint reader, work pretty well.</p>
<p>There are a number of guides from the <a title="ThinkWiki" href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki" target="_blank">ThinkWiki</a> website that helped me a lot. Among them :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Debian_Lenny_on_a_ThinkPad_T61" target="_blank">http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Debian_Lenny_on_a_ThinkPad_T61</a></p>
<p>Set up the active protection (patch and recompile the kernel :( ) :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Debian_Lenny_on_a_ThinkPad_T60#hdapsd">http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Debian_Lenny_on_a_ThinkPad_T60#hdapsd </a></p>
<p>Get the fingerprint reader work :</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ThinkFinger" target="_blank">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ThinkFinger </a></p>
<p>However, after a few days, I realized that I was not satisfied by the responsiveness of  the laptop, and especially the way it managed multiprocessing. I also wanted to use the active protection for my hard drive.</p>
<p>I decided to compile my own kernel, more optimized than the generic AMD 64 one provided by Debian.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from my .config file activating some features for a Core 2 Duo Intel processor &#8211; this apply to the latest version of Linux today, 2.6.24-2 :</p>

</pre>
<p>The important differences with the standard kernel are :</p>
<ul>
<li> the timer frequency set to &#8220;1000 Hz&#8221;,</li>
<li>processor familly to &#8220;Core 2&#8221;</li>
<li>preemption model to &#8220;Voluntary&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>I am seeing now better performance in threading and global responsiveness &#8211; including, believe it or not, with the compiz effect, what I didn&#8217;t expect at all.</p>
<p>At the end, I just have hibernation not working : it is nice to see how good the support of Debian Lenny is, thought the hardware is pretty recent. Things are really improving quickly.</p>
<p>If you have some issue installing Linux on your Thinpad,  post your problem here. I will be happy to help you as much as I can.</p>
