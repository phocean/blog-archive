<p>I tried it out and I must say that the new UI is great. I am not a big fan of Flash and I regret this choice. However, the design is excellent, all options are accessible in a logical way. Instead of spreading over the options like it used to be, they come to you in the right order.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that the server and the client set-up are now unified thanks to the web interface (you can access it from localhost or from the network indifferently).</p>
<p>The report section has also been greatly improved.</p>
<p>So, if you were already an Nessus user, it is worth upgrading.</p>
<p>Talking about the set-up, there is an up-to-date package for openSUSE (of course, there are a lot less dependencies than before).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I work on security, I used to use Nessus on my openSUSE system.</p>
<p>But it seems that <a href="https://discussions.nessus.org/message/2011#2011" target="_blank">Tenable Network Security dropped support for the client on our favorite distribution</a>.</p>
<p>At least, for some reason, they stopped making an universal statically linked binary (though they keep doing it for the server part) and it hasn&#8217;t changed since april.</p>
<p>Even the server has a rather limited and obsolete support of openSUSE 10, whereas Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora have support for various versions and architectures. Check <a href="http://nessus.org/download/nessus_download.php" target="_blank">there</a>.</p>
<p>This is rather a shame, as openSUSE is one of the major distribution.</p>
<p>I tried some workarounds like converting the deb packages, but, as expected, there are some dependancies issues.</p>
<p>So far, it seems that not many people are affected, because there are not many voices on the forum. I can live without it, but however, this is often a nice and useful tool.</p>
<p>Does anyone use it here ? Or did you get it to work somehow ? If you feel concerned, please let it know to Tenable !</p>
