				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At my work, I had to overwrite a MSSQL database while in production. The goal was to replace the existing database by one with a new structure.</p>
<p>I tried first the easy way, right clicking on it and trying to take it off line using the menu of Microsoft.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that didn&#8217;t do anything, complaining that several users were accessing it. Of course, trying to restore it directly gave the same message.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a way to successfully force it through the interface.<br />
<span id="more-23"></span></p>
<p>It was, of course, a multiuser database on which always an user was working on, making it impossible to overwrite it.</p>
<p>So, at this point, I had to consider using the SQL query tool, to enjoy the power of a command line interface (you see what I mean).</p>
<p>Below is the kind of request I submited :</p>
<pre>use master;
alter database $your_database set single_user with rollback immediate;
backup database $your_database to disk = 'C:\$your_database.bak' with init,Name = 'backup';
restore database $your_database from disk = 'C:\path\to\your\DB\$your_new_database.bak' with replace,file=1,recovery
alter database Datasharing_Translation set multi_user with rollback immediate;</pre>
<p>It switches the database to the single user mode, make a backup of it (for safety), make the restoring operation, and finally switches it back to the multi user mode.</p>

Once again the day is saved by a command line tool !  ;)</p>
