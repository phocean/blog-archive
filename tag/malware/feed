				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soktspy is a small script that may be helpful for some investigation.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may detect that some suspicious network traffic coming out from a machine. In general, it is easy to spot the process from which the packets originate. You somehow connect to the PC and look for open sockets.</p>
<p>But sometimes, the behavior may be very sneaky, consisting of one or two packets, at rare and random intervals. Unless you spend all the day before the screen, it may be very difficult to trace.</p>
<p>Especially with stock tools or without installing any intrusive hardware, which is also the reason why I did this tool. On a production server, you want to install as little dependencies as possible, right?</p>
<p>So here is the Soktspy, a python script that easily build into a portable and standalone executable to deploy on the target machine.</p>
<p>Once launched, it just loops in the background and log sockets that are created for some given peers (the IP addresses you found involved in the suspicious network activity).</p>
<p>Maybe, some other tool exist, but I could not find anything similar. Let me know if you have any suggestion. Anyway, it was a nice exercise to do :)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1257" title="soktspy01" src="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktspy01.png" alt="" width="668" height="427" srcset="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktspy01.png 668w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktspy01-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p><strong>Download</strong></p>
<p><a href="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktSpy-v1.2.zip">soktSpy v1.2</a></p>
<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Install Visual C++ Runtime libraries with v<strong>credist_x86.exe </strong>(not necessary if the target machine happens to have Python already installed)</li>
</ul>
<div>So far, I tested it successfully on Windows XP, Windows 2003, Ubuntu 11.10 and Mac OS Lion. But as it is a simple Python script, it is supposed to work on all platform.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Compiling</strong></p>
<p>You may recompile the program as a Windows binary executable by issuing this command:</p>
<p><strong>&gt; setup.py py2exe</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>How to use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Copy <strong>soktSpy.exe </strong>and its configuration file <strong>config.cfg</strong>.</li>
<li>Edit <strong>config.cfg </strong>with the IP you want to monitor</li>
<li>Start <strong>soktSpy.exe</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, as soon as the sneaky process will send out a packet toward the monitored IP, a log record will be triggered:</p>
<p><a href="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktspy02.png" rel="lightbox[1254]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1255" title="soktspy02" src="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktspy02-1024x327.png" alt="" width="1024" height="327" srcset="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktspy02-1024x327.png 1024w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktspy02-300x96.png 300w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/soktspy02.png 1118w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The log file contains the following info, in that order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection time (based on the system local time)</li>
<li>Process creation time</li>
<li>PID</li>
<li>Process Name</li>
<li>Protocol Family (2 = IPv4, 23 = IPv6)</li>
<li>Process Owner</li>
<li>Source socket (IP, port)</li>
<li>Destination socket (IP, port)</li>
<li>Socket Status</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
<p>Please tell me if you have any idea on how to improve it.</p>
<p>For now, I plan to add a feature that will dump the memory of the suspicious processes when it is executing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Linux desktop is in bad shape&#8230;</h2>
<p>The culprits? Unity and Gnome 3. I am not talking about KDE, as I never felt good with it. I had tried KDE 4 and it did not change my opinion, not to mention that I suffered from several bugs.</p>
<p>Unity? Like many people, I just don&#8217;t get it. It is pretty clumsy and feels unachieved. I also suffered from a lot of performance issues like <a title="Unity lag" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/764330" target="_blank">this</a> that are never fixed and make it a pain to use daily.<br />
Gnome 3? Actually, I liked it. It looks nice, is pretty fast and smooth. What I like the most is the workflow. It really makes use of workspaces logical and optimum. But&#8230; it did not work for me! Instability, <a title="Gnome 3 VMWare hang" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/869408" target="_blank">again</a> and <a title="Gnome 3 and ATI" href="http://ati.cchtml.com/show_bug.cgi?id=99" target="_blank">again</a>.<br />
You will tell me, that I should have stayed with Gnome 2 or go to XFCE / Openbox / etc. I have used all of them. They have qualities, sure, but we are in 2012 and I want something with more features.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: it is sad that after so many years, Linux is not yet ready for the desktop, because some guys decided to break everything again instead of doing incremental enhancements. Why breaking so suddenly things that work? I don&#8217;t get it. I felt really fustrated with the feeling that I was at the same point as 5 years ago, dealing with the same kind of bugs. I have long been a Linux advocate and I believed I was right a few years back when I told people it was promising and superior to the competition (Windows XP at the time). Now years have passed, and I started to feel I was lying, or hiding the truth that is Linux Desktop failed and went nowhere.<br />
Yes, I just got tired to fight with the computer to get basic things done. And considering the <a title="Linus Thorvalds on Gnome 3" href="https://plus.google.com/102150693225130002912/posts/UkoAaLDpF4i" target="_blank">Linus post</a> and several reactions into the comments, I am not alone in this case.</p>
<h2>&#8230; so I gave a try to Apple&#8230;</h2>
<p>I recently got a Mac Book Pro. The main reason is I wanted a very stable workstation to focus on my work. It was hard to admit after so many years using it, but I came to the conclusion that a Linux desktop could not meet this requirement anymore.</p>
<p>So I am going to be with Mac OS Lion for a while (though I am certainly not closing the door to the Linux desktop forever). I have to say that it is a nice OS and it is damned stable. It is good to have something that works out of the box, without any frustration or need to customize things to have something suitable.</p>
<p>And what about the stability of Mac OS? It is very eye candy, but is it stable?</p>
<p>At first, I actually had some serious troubles. It was freezing almost every day, forcing me to a cold reboot. I started to be seriously doubtful concerning the stability of Mac OS, when I found by chance that the freeze occured every time that Sophos Antivirus started an update&#8230;</p>
<h2>Antivirus and Mac OS&#8230;</h2>
<p>Wait, what? Antivirus? On Mac OS? I know it will be the reaction of many Mac users. I do also think that it is useless, but for a different reason than most of them.<br />
Of course, I don&#8217;t get the &#8220;Mac OS is secure&#8221; marketing. Actually, it has the less secure kernel around, even though it benefits from a robust Unix architecture.<br />
No, my point is that antivirus all fail anyway. In forensic analysis, we can even not trust an antivirus scan to decide if a machine is sane or not. Instead, we have to use specific tools and memory acquisition to make sure.<br />
It is simply because signature-based detection can always be worked around by malwares. There are hundreds of ways to achieve it successfully: changing binary headers, code obfuscation, encryption, hooking (see rootkits and bootkits).<br />
Ok, antivirus vendors claim that they also offer behavioral detection, sandboxes, etc. Yes, that&#8217;s a good move, but they can&#8217;t check all of the system activity and again there are many ways to bypass it. So why bother?</p>
<p>I mean, I still think it matters to have an antivirus on Windows. Especially for people who are not too techy. At least, it will detect the most basics threats and throw out alarms. There are thousands of such threats on Windows, and on this point antivirus offer a simple way to defeat them (though awareness and education are certainly more important).</p>
<p>But on Mac Os, and on Linux as well, there are very few threats. Once again, it is not that they are so much secure, but at the time I am writing, it is a fact.</p>
<p>So to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>very few threats on Mac OS and Linux</li>
<li>antivirus still massively rely on signature-based detection</li>
</ul>
<p>You see: if there is nothing much to detect, an antivirus is overhead. It will only eat some resources and fail anyway against coming threats.<br />
Just keeping the system up-to-date is certainly the best thing to do so far.</p>
<p>Well, so why did I set an antivirus? I was actually using it for my forensic analysis on Windows machines. It was a convenient way for me to have a local scanner that I could started on dumped suspicious processes, without having to connect on Viruscan. It used to be convenient when I was traveling without connection, but I can live without it.</p>
<h2>About Sophos for Mac OS</h2>
<p>So moreover this piece of software was crashing my laptop. The update part seems to be executed with root privileges, and for some reason it locks the system (not only mine, <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Version-8-s-AutoUpdate-consistently-CRASHING/td-p/5957o29DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa-t6bKUNhGqDIdvtkicGvsdvMmg" target="_blank">look</a> <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Sophos-AV-7-3-8C-Crashed-MacBook-Pro-AGAIN-Unacceptable-Software/td-p/5397" target="_blank">at</a> <a href="http://openforum.sophos.com/t5/Sophos-Anti-Virus-for-Mac-Home/Given-up-temporarily-on-Sophos-for-Mac/td-p/3703" target="_blank">the</a> forums). Not to mention that having such a component may offer more room to malicious code to exploit the kernel&#8230;</p>
<p>A shame, a pure piece of crap. Now that I removed it, I am enjoying an uptime of about 30 days!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1235" title="Sophos Antivirus for Mac OS: a piece of crap" src="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1086d0317ba5fbde3728edad856d5744.js" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sophos Antivirus for Mac OS is pure crap, run to remove it if it happens to be on your computer.</p>
<p>Anyway, you don&#8217;t need an antivirus on Mac OS. Moreover, it seems that several vendor offer solution that lack of maturity and testing on this platform. So you would actually degrade your system stability and security if you would installed on of these.</p>
<p>And Mac OS is a nice Unix-based desktop alternative to have the work done, even though sadly it is not open-source.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Analyzing the MBR is sometimes required during a forensic process, if you suspect a malicious activity that is not detected on-line. With static analysis, you may see if an obvious corruption happened, but you will need to debug to learn more.</p>
<h2>Prerequisite :</h2>
<ul>
<li>IDA Pro (6.0) with the IDA Python plug-in (1.4.3)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps :</h2>
<ol>
<li>Prepare your forensic disk image.<br />
In general, it is that simple :</p>
<pre>$ dd if=&lt;source&gt; of=disk.img bs=65536 conv=noerror</pre>
<p>Or :</p>
<pre>$ ddrescue -n &lt;source&gt; &lt;dest&gt; file.log</pre>
<p>Check the disk geometry using :</p>
<pre>$ fdisk -luc disk.img</pre>
<p>These values will be useful for step 5.<br />
However, if you have an exotic disk, it may be much trickier. For example, I got some geometry errors with a flash disk when using Bochs at step 11. Special thanks to Gene Cumm from the bochs-developpers mailing list who gave me the tip to specify the geometry to dd :</p>
<pre>$ dd if=input of=output bs=2064384 count=507</pre>
</li>
<p>Refer to <a title="CHS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder-head-sector" target="_blank">CHS</a> if you wonder how to get these values.</p>
<li>Extract the MBR from the disk or from the image you just took.
<pre>$ dd if=&lt;source&gt; of=mbr.dump bs=512 count=5</pre>
</li>
<li>Download and install the <a title="Bochs emulator" href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Bochs x86-64 emulator</a>, which comes with a debugger that will work nicely with IDA.</li>
<li>Download <a title="MBR Bochs scripts" href="http://hexblog.com/ida_pro/files/mbr_bochs.zip" target="_self">this archive</a> from Hexblog (IDA Pro&#8217;s blog). We will use two files from there : <em>bochrc</em>, wich is the configuration file for Bochs, and <em>mbr.py</em> which a python file helpful from preparing the debugging environment.</li>
<li> Copy <em>bochrc</em> in your working directory and edit the following line to match your disk image geometry :
<pre>ata0-master: type=disk, path="sdb.img", mode=flat, cylinders=507, heads=64, spt=63</pre>
<p>Before going on, you may test that Bochs can use the image with these settings :</p>
<pre>C:\&gt;"c:\Program Files\Bochs-2.4.5\bochsdbg.exe" -f bochsrc -q</pre>
</li>
<li>In the same directory, copy <em>mbr.py</em> and edit the following settings :
<pre># Some constants
SECTOR_SIZE = 512
BOOT_START  = 0x7C00
BOOT_SIZE   = 0x7C00 + SECTOR_SIZE * 4
BOOT_END    = BOOT_START + BOOT_SIZE
SECTOR2     = BOOT_START + SECTOR_SIZE
MBRNAME    = "mbr.img"
IMGNAME     = "sdb.img"</pre>
</li>
<li>Now open a console and type :
<pre>C:\&gt; mbr update</pre>
</li>
<li>With IDA Pro, open the <em>boshrc</em> file. IDA should recognize the format and set the proper settings.</li>
<li>From the menu, open <em>File/Script File</em> and select <em>mbr.py</em>. It will close IDA after execution.</li>
<li>Open again your <em>*.idb</em> file, set a breakpoint at <em>0x7C00</em>.</li>
<li>Start the debugger.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to go ahead and debug the MBR step by step.</p>

<p>Who would need it these days where all distros include tools and script to update the DNS with DHCP. At worst, it is just a matter of opening an editor to add two lines in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. Done in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>To enjoy dns-add, we are supposed to compile the source code. Let&#8217;s have a look at it first.</p>
<p>It gets quickly obvious that there could be something nasty. The code is clearly obfuscated, to make it difficult to read:</p>
<ul>
<li>not much commented,</li>
<li>a bunch of strange variables like &#8220;\026\243\314\376\220\366\154\166\346\334\005\116\360\114\015\231&#8221;. Could be the real code, hidden,</li>
<li>None of the visible stuff seems to do anything on the DNS.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now, let&#8217;s try to find out what&#8217;s behind all that. As we have the source code, the idea is to understand what the code is doing, so that we can write a snippet at the right place to just read the deciphered and potentially malicious code. That&#8217;s the easiest way, no need to disassembly and do memory forensic.</p>
<p>A good practice is to look for some pieces of code on the web, as developpers are lazy and often reuse already existing code. Doing that, you can save a lot of time.</p>
<p>Bingo ! There is a code almost entirely identical <a title="RedHat update malware" href="http://packetstormsecurity.nl/0410-advisories/FakeRedhatPatchAnalysis.txt" target="_blank">there</a>.<br />
We learn that the code, as old as 6 years old, actually hid a shell trojan instead of beeing a Red Hat update as claimed.</p>
<p>There is clearly a risk, so we must check what the code of dns-add contains. Here more hints help us again about the encoding used : some comments and a function name mention RC4 (or ARC4).</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s see how RC4 works and compare it with its possible implementation in dns-add.<br />
Rougly, RC4 is just an improved XOR whith the help of a lot of keys permutations. I found a clear and short description <a title="RC4" href="http://www.frontiernet.net/~fys/cypher.htm" target="_blank">there</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>RC4 has two phases: key setup and ciphering.</p>
<p>The key setup phase is only done once per message and starts by initializing the entire state array so that the first state element is zero, the second is one, the third is two, and so on.</p>
<p>The state array is then subjected to 256 mixing operations using a loop that steps i through the values from zero to 255.</p>
<p>Each mixing operation consists of two steps:<br />
Add to the variable j the contents of the ith element of the state array and the nth element of the key, where n is equal to i modulo the length of the key.  (remember, the key here means the 10 byte IV at the front of the file, (or the one your program creates, if encoding), and the given key on the command line. (Key+IV)<br />
Swap the ith and jth elements of the state array.</p>
<p>After the entire mixing loop is completed, i and j are set to zero.</p>
<p>During the ciphering operation, the following steps are performed for each byte of the message:</p>
<p>The variable i is incremented by one<br />
The contents of the ith element of &#8216;State&#8217; is then added to j<br />
The ith and jth elements of &#8216;State&#8217; are swapped and their contents are added together to form a new value n.<br />
The nth element of &#8216;State&#8217; is then combined with the message byte, using a bit by bit exclusive-or operation (XOR), to form the output byte.<br />
The same ciphering steps are performed for encryption and for decryption.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>void key(void * str, int len)</em></strong> for setting the key setup phase and <strong><em>void arc4(void * str, int len, char *hint)</em></strong> for the deciphering phase do exactly what&#8217;s described above.</p>
<p>They are called by <em><strong>char * xsh(int argc, char ** argv)</strong></em>, which we are going to look at carefully now.</p>
<p>This function succevely setup all keys and decipher all the hardcoded vars. Note that a function, <strong><em>chkenv,</em></strong> setup a variable in the environment, based on the PID (and other tricks). It is not useful in the present case, but it could be developped further and used for example to avoid over-infections.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is actually the bottom of the function, where the guy actually builds the shellcode, putting alltogether the pieces of deciphered code.</p>
<pre>j = 0;
varg[j++] = argv[0];		/* My own name at execution */
if (ret && *opts)
	varg[j++] = opts;	/* Options on 1st line of code */
if (*inlo)
	varg[j++] = inlo;	/* Option introducing inline code */
varg[j++] = scrpt;		/* The script itself */
if (*lsto)
	varg[j++] = lsto;	/* Option meaning last option */
i = (ret > 1) ? ret : 0;	/* Args numbering correction */
while (i < argc)
	varg[j++] = argv[i++];	/* Main run-time arguments */
varg[j] = 0;			/* NULL terminated array */</pre>
<p>Then, it is launched with execvp:</p>
<pre>
#if DEBUGEXEC
debugexec(shll, j, varg);
#endif
execvp(shll, varg);
return shll;
</pre>
<p><strong>Before testing further, it is safer to comment out the execvp line.</strong></p>
<p>Now, we just need to retrieve the shellcode, so we just add this lazy piece of code (to insert right before #if DEBUGEXEC):</p>
<pre>
FILE *fout;
char **tmp;
tmp = varg;
fout = fopen ("dns-test","w");
do {
  fprintf (fout, *tmp);
}
while (*tmp++ != NULL);
fclose (fout);</pre>
<p>Here we go :</p>

<p>Technically, at the end, it is rather basic. However, it is successful in the way that it hides its purpose to most people.<br />
What's not clear yet is the poster purpose. Fun ? Any other weired feeling ? Or just testing the capacity of the community to detect maliscious software ? If so, was he just curious or does he have any future plan ?<br />
Maybe I should ask him.</p>
<p>Anyway, how many people opened and read the code ? Especially on a community driven website where people tend to have a dangerous feeling of trust and safety : it can't be malicious, the author offers the source code and nicely shares his work, right ?<br />
And among the few people who checked the code, who really understood it ? Not everyone is an IT specialist. And even among them, not everyone is a developper or can read C.</p>
<p>It highlights well several things :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>social engineering is multi-platform ! </strong>We are often more vulnerable than our systems. Linux user or not.</li>
<li><strong>software published with the source code doesn't mean safe software</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as possible, download software exclusively from the official repositories of your favorite distribution (openSUSE ;)).<br />
If you really have to use code from an untrusted source, check it, or wait for the right people to do it! Don't just grab any code, compile it and execute it blindly.</p>
<p>At the same time as open-source software grows, we, users, and also websites like Sourceforge will have to be more carefull about the content we download.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">* Update *</span></em></span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #993300;">I did contact the author and didn't get any answer.<br />
I reported the issue to Sourceforge, which deleted the account hosting dns-add, as it violated the website policies.</span></em></p>
