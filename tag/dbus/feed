				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Console-Kit spawns 35 threads on my system, which is a waste considering that I use at most 7 vty. But it is definitely useless on a server (you don&#8217;t need fast switching stuff). Dbus and Hal are also not useful on a server and consuming resources for nothing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they are settled with the default basic installation and they have some dependencies (e.g the kernel and zypper) that make them impossible to simply uninstall .</p>
<p>Here is a way to at least deactivate these services at startup on openSUSE 11.2 (it might also work with 11.3).</p>
<p>First, ConsoleKit is not a standalone daemon anymore on the latest versions of openSUSE. It is started along with dbus (you will see that if you stop dbus, all the ConsoleKit thread will magically vanish).</p>
<p>But trying straight to remove dbus from the startup doesn&#8217;t work, because of dependencies among services. On my system, it complained like this:</p>
<pre># chkconfig dbus off
 insserv: Service dbus has to be enabled to start service bluez-coldplug
 insserv: Service dbus has to be enabled to start service network
 insserv: Service dbus has to be enabled to start service haldaemon
 insserv: Service dbus has to be enabled to start service earlyxdm
 insserv: exiting now!
 /sbin/insserv failed, exit code 1
 [1]    7954 exit 1     chkconfig dbus off</pre>
<p>So, let&#8217;s remove the bluetooth stuff:</p>
<pre># zypper remove bluez</pre>
<p>Then, we just deactivate the services that can&#8217;t uninstalled:</p>
<pre># chkconfig earlyxdm off
# chkconfig network-remotefs off
# chkconfig haldaemon off</pre>
<p>You will probably want to keep the network service on, otherwise your configurations scripts won&#8217;t be read anymore. In fact, we will just edit the dependency of the startup script itself, by editing /etc/init.d/network and editing these lines:</p>
<pre># Required-Start:    $local_fs dbus
# Required-Stop:    $local_fs dbus</pre>
<p>What we do is just deleting the dbus word, so that the script section looks like it:</p>
<pre>### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:        network
# Required-Start:    $local_fs
# Should-Start:        isdn openibd SuSEfirewall2_init
# Required-Stop:    $local_fs
# Should-Stop:        isdn openibd SuSEfirewall2_init
# Default-Start:    2 3 5
# Default-Stop:
# Short-Description:    Configure the localfs depending network interfaces
# Description:        Configure the localfs depending network interfaces
#                       and set up routing
### END INIT INFO</pre>
<p>Now we are done and we should be able to definitely turn dbus off:</p>
<pre># chkconfig dbus off</pre>
<p>Bingo! I didn&#8217;t monitor the memory precisely, but I believe I saved around 50 MB, which is always welcomed on a small server.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it is the best way &#8211; I may have missed something &#8211; however I am pretty happy as it now works as I wanted. Please let me know if you have a better tip.</p>
