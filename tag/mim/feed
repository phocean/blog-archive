				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>MD5</strong> was found vulnerable a few years ago. Recently, <a title="MD5 : fake CA SSL cert" href="http://www.secuobs.com/news/31122008-md5_pki_cluster_ps3_25c3_certificat.shtml" target="_blank">a team succeeded in producing a fake CA SSL certificate</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MD5</strong> or <strong>SHA-1</strong> is the algorithm used to authenticate the peer in SSL messages. If it gets compromised, and using various combined technics, it becomes possible to do a <strong>MiM</strong> attack.</p>
<p>But too much noise has been made about it. There is <a title="MD5" href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/01/new-pki-problem-resolved.html" target="_blank">a nice reaction</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it still requires a lot of efforts and conditions for the attack to be possible. And the CPU power is still huge : the researchers used not less than a cluster of <strong>200 PS3</strong> to drive the attack. Even with that hardware and engineering, it took until 3 days of intensive computation.</p>
<p>Not everyone can afford it, nor would have much motivation to attack a single user like this.</p>
<p>Security has always been a compromise between usuability and risk. Today, the risk concerning MD5 is still low enough to stop this wind of panic.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin the migration to SHA-1 quietly.</p>
