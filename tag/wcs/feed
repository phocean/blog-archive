				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a chance to audit this device during a Wi-Fi pentest. <em>Cisco Prime Network Control System </em>is a Wi-Fi controller that allows to manage multiple access points and centralize their configuration: Wi-Fi settings, access control, security, etc.</p>
<p>I was surprised how easy it was to compromise this equipment, thanks to default credentials. Of course, Cisco published a patch… however how many network teams would have applied the patch ? Routers, switches, Wi-Fi controllers, especially when they are not part of the core infrastructure, are often dropped and forgotten for years&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is the vendor <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/mcontent/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130410-ncs">advisory</a>, which is about &#8220;unspecified&#8221; default credentials. With a little of ninja googling, I managed to glue the pieces.</p>
<p>It was not that easy to find the credentials in questions, but the guys from Tenable Security managed to get the <a href="http://tenablenetworksecurity.info/plugins/index.php?view=single&amp;id=66861">info</a>: <code>wcsdba / wcs123</code>.</p>
<p>Now, you will think, &#8220;ok, but we need to find a way to reach the database&#8230;&#8217;. Piece of cake! By default, the device exposes an Oracle listener on port <code>1522</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we would need to know the Oracle instance… Don&#8217;t think too much, don&#8217;t even look up at your wordlists, this is just: <code>WCS</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, as you should guess now, the account has <em>DBA</em> privileges. :-)</p>
<p>So, in summary:</p>
<pre>Oracle listener on port <strong>TCP 1522</strong>
Instance: <strong>WCS</strong>
Account: <strong>wcsdba</strong>
Password: <strong>wcs123</strong>
Privileges: <strong>DBA</strong></pre>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Now you can do pretty much every thing: control network settings, grab and crack password hashes, etc.</span></p>
<p>Besides, there is also an XSS on a login page&#8230;</p>
<p>Well done Cisco, for not hardening anything.  :-/</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
