				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had been long wondering how are these subsitute batteries that you can find all around the web and why there are so cheap compared to the laptop constructor ones.<br />
I was affraid about the quality, the design and even the safety.<br />
I often buy substitute ink for my printer, but that is not exactly the same kind of thing nor the same price.</p>
<p><span id="more-18"></span></p>
<p>But my need overpassed my fears.</p>
<p>I found one rather cheap on this <a hreflang="en" href="http://www.global-batteries.com/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=fs215&amp;submit=Search%21">website</a>. I mean much cheaper than the one from Sony, which was around 300 â‚¬ !!! And this is always very expensive whatever the brand is.<br />
At this price, it is better to buy a new laptop (maybe that&#8217;s what they aim).</p>
<p>I chose the one with a bigger power and payed with paypal. Surprisingly, I received it quickly, just two days after my purchase.</p>
<p>Concerning the quality of this battery, so far, I am very happy. Over my expectations. The design exactly look like the Sony one. I guess it just come out from the same factory but doesn&#8217;t have the Sony stick&#8230;</p>
<p>This new battery has 7200 mAh and offers me about 4h30 of work on battery ! To be compared with the 2h30 I had with the original one (and only 1h more recently).</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t be affraid anymore to buy no-name replacement batteries !<br />
I will definitely so in the future, when I need.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I just upgraded my laptop from 512 Mb of RAM to 1 Gb.</p> <p>Well, I was expecting quite a lot from this upgrade. I am using an Ubuntu 6.10 OS and having a dozen of applications running at the same time : Firefox, Liferea, Evolution, Open Office, Skype, Gaim, Beagle, plus a dozen of applets (Tomboy, Mail Notification, Deskbar, etc), small programs or other accessories.</p>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just upgraded my laptop from 512 Mb of RAM to 1 Gb.</p>
<p>Well, I was expecting quite a lot from this upgrade. I am using an Ubuntu 6.10 OS and having a dozen of applications running at the same time : Firefox, Liferea, Evolution, Open Office, Skype, Gaim, Beagle, plus a dozen of applets (Tomboy, Mail Notification, Deskbar, etc), small programs or other accessories.</p>
<p><span id="more-7"></span></p>
<p>You may guess how swappy it was. And having a 4200 rpm hard drive doesn&#8217;t really help.</p>
<p>I became almost crazy every time I had to use VMWare to run a Windows XP. The great memory management of Linux made it possible where it would have been unthinkable on a windows host, but it was still a painful exercise every time I had to get in and out of the WMWare guest.</p>
<p>I have even been thinking of buying a new laptop. But I decided it was not the time for that :</p>
<ol>
<li>I use little CPU in my daily work and even the celeron processor of my Sony VGN-FS215E laptop is not much used. It is not time for me yet to get a core duo.</li>
<li>A new laptop is expensive and mine is still quite recent.</li>
<li>There are going to be new technologies soon, which could be very interesting for the laptops : new kind of batteries and hard drives with built-in flash memory (to speed-up and save power).</li>
</ol>
<p>So I finally decided to change the two 256 Mb modules for 512 Mb ones (because of dual transport). Hmm it was expensive so I didn&#8217;t want to get disappointed&#8230;</p>
<p>And now this is great ! It is much over what I expected. The system is now running smoothly, even with a virtual host running. The terrible hard drive is less often in use and that makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Yes, 1 Gb has been the standard for a while and it was time for me to get it ! I feel much more relaxed while I am working. Now, I plan soon to change my hard drive for a 7200 Rpm Hitachi one. No doubt it will be smoother and give me better startup performances.</p>
<p>My plan is now to enjoy my Vaio one more year. Do most of people need a core duo processor on their laptop ? I don&#8217;t think so, but many people may think they need when their computer is swapping&#8230; cunning marketing !</p>
