				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had several issues with <strong>gnome-power-manager</strong> and <strong>acpi-support</strong>.</p>
<p>Both are base on the <strong>acpid</strong> daemon for power management. Acpi-support is a convenient package of scripts to configure the power management.</p>
<p>It is bundled in many distributions, including Ubuntu and Debian.</p>
<p>The problem is that it does not cooperate very well with gnome-power-manager. As a result, I had many small but anoying issues.</p>
<p>The most anoying was, that after a suspend / hibernation, gnome-power-manager was not able anymore to turn off the screen for power saving. Workaround : kill it and start it again. Not good !</p>
<p>Pretty annoying, especially since I stopped using a screen saver with my LCD screens&#8230;</p>
<p>So I tried a new alternative to acpi-support : <strong>pm-utils</strong>. This is another collection of scripts, attached to the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org" target="_blank">Freedesktop.org</a> project, as gnome-power-manager : the integration with Gnome should now be much better, shouldn&#8217;t it ?</p>
<p>So :</p>
<pre>$ aptitude remove acpi-support
$ aptitude install pm-utils</pre>
<p>Now we copy the default configuration file to the /etc directory. All files will be parsed, but the one in /etc has the priority if you change a value :</p>
<pre>$ cp /usr/lib/pm-utils/defaults /etc/pm/config.d/</pre>
<p>With my laptop, I had to edit a line to activate suspend-to-ram, so that it looks like :</p>
<pre>S2RAM_OPTS=&quot;-f -a 3&quot;</pre>
<p>And that&#8217;s it ! I did not go deeper, but there are already much fewer issues with gnome-power-manager (though it still need some work).</p>
