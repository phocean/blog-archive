				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I just finished setting TLS and SASL to secure the access to my Postfix server, I realized that it was working only from inside my network.</p>
<p>What I got from my lan :</p>
<pre>$ telnet mars 25
Trying 192.168.222.10...
Connected to phocean.net.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 phocean.net ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)
ehlo phocean.net
250-phocean.net
250-PIPELINING
250-SIZE 200000000

250-ETRN
250-STARTTLS
250-AUTH NTLM DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5
250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
250-8BITMIME
250 DSN</pre>
<p>I shows well that the TLS handshake is initiated.</p>
<p>But from this outside, I just got this weired thing :</p>
<pre>$ telnet phocean.net 25
Trying 81.64.194.119...
Connected to phocean.net.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 **********************************************
ehlo phocean.net
502 5.5.2 Error: command not recognized</pre>
<p>Of course, the firewall, a Cisco Pix one, was properly set to redirect port 25 UDP/TCP to my server.</p>
<p>However, I soon focused my effort on this equipment. I considered a while that the cause could be some filtering from my provider, but most probably, the problem came from the Pix.</p>
<p>That was not difficult to figure out : it had some protocol inspector activated for SMTP :</p>
<pre>$ sh ru
[...]
fixup protocol smtp 25
[...]</pre>
<p>Just after :</p>
<pre>&gt; no fixup protocol smtp 25</pre>
<p>&#8230; it started to work perfectly well !!!</p>
<p>The engine for the SMTP protocol could not recognize the TLS handshake, considered that the SMTP session as not valid and therefore blocked it !</p>
<p>I can deactivate it without any fear as my Postfix server is already pretty well secured, or at least configured to reject any weired SMTP dialog.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I suddenly started to received some undelivered mail notifications while I was trying to send some messages to a mailbox hosted on my Postfix server.</p>
<p>The cause described in the notification was :</p>
<pre>error writing message: File too large</pre>
<p>The first thing I did was checking my configuration file,<strong> main.cf</strong>.<br />
It seemed all right :</p>
<pre>[...]
mailbox_size_limit = 0
message_size_limit = 200000000
[...]</pre>
<p>Note that &#8220;0&#8221; means unlimited.<br />
I checked the mailbox in question : it was nearing the size of 50 Mb.</p>
<p>I started to think that during some Postfix update, the meaning of the value &#8220;0&#8221; may have changed.<br />
I tried different values without success.</p>
<p>I started to become crazy with that, but, finally, after quite a long time spent on google, I finally found <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1325">the trick</a>, which is just a simple line to add in <strong>main.cf</strong> :</p>
<pre>virtual_mailbox_limit = 0</pre>
<p>Indeed, I use virtual users as mail account ! I just never imagined there was a differtent setting for virtual users (which can be a convenient setting in some case).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I usually avoid using Webmin, but I had to set it up for a company I worked for.</p>
<p>The guys there were not familiar with Linux and they needed an interface to keep configuring the Postfix server I settled (with Spamassassin as an antispam and Amavis as content filtering).</p>
<p>I had to face a problem while I was trying to get the Postfix Webmin module working.</p>
<p><span id="more-17"></span><br />
The error message was quite cryptic. Just this single line on a blank screen every time I tried to apply a configuration change :<br />
<span lang="EN-GB"><strong>usr/sbin/postconf: fatal: gethostbyname: Success</strong></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">After looking on the net, I learned that this Webmin module uses the <strong>getbyhostname()</strong> function to resolve the server name, instead of using the DNS service as Postfix do.</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the message indicates that the machine name could not be resolved for some reason.<br />
There are several possibilities.</p>
<p>First, check your <span><strong>/etc/hosts</strong> file</span>, it must contain your machine name</p>
<p>Then, in your<strong> /etc/postfix/main.cf</strong> configuration file, you might have this line (especially on Debian systems) :</p>
<pre>myorigin = /etc/mailname</pre>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">If so, check that <strong>/etc/mailname</strong> contains your machine name, as /etc/hosts do.</span></p>
<p>Finally, also check that in <span lang="EN-GB"><strong>/etc/postfix/main.cf</strong>, the <strong>myhostname</strong> field is correct :<br />
</span></p>
<pre>myhostname = mail.phocean.net</pre>
<p>If you made any change in main.cf, restart postfix and that should be fine !</p>
