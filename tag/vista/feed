<p>Unfortunately, I could not attend any conference, but I had a quick and nice view of the exhibition.  All the major actors were there and I had a good time talking with some people about the trends.</p>

<p>It was fun to see that Microsoft was there in small stand. But more fun was that there were turning around in small cars, just in front of the building of Linux Solutions.</p>

<p>Beside that, it was great to learn the news that a french car makers, Peugeot, will swith 20 000 of its PC and 2500 of its server to the Novell Linux solution.</p>
<p>It seems that times are changing&#8230; and I am sure that shiny marketing won&#8217;t change anything !</p>
