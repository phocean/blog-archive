				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rights management on Linux is enough for most use.<br />
In a few words, a file or a directory belongs to the owner and what you can do is positionning some right to this owner, to his group or all other users (= guests).<br />
This is not bad, but sometimes you (or your application) may need more advanced right management, as on the latest windows versions : putting several owners with different rights, inheritance, etc.<br />
There are named ACL (Access List Management) and they are supported on Linux also.<br />
This is not going to be an how-to but just a brief informative introduction to ACL on Linux. You will find many how-to on the web if you need more.</p>
<p><span id="more-25"></span></p>
<p>Fisrt, you will need a kernel that supports ACL. As far as I now, most of modern distributions include it in their 2.6.x kernel.</p>
<p>To ensure, type :</p>
<pre lang="bash">$ grep ACL /boot/config-<em>kernel-version</em></pre>
<p>If your kernel supports it, you will get many lines like :</p>
<pre lang="text">CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
...</pre>
<p>If you don&#8217;t, you will have to recompile your kernel with the right module.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that we are going to add ACL management to the<strong> /home</strong> partition (on <strong>/dev/sda3</strong>) :</p>
<pre lang="bash">$ mount -t ext3 -o defaults,acl /dev/sda3/ /home</pre>
<p>Or, if<strong> /home</strong> were already mounted :</p>
<pre lang="bash">$ mount -o remount,acl /home</pre>
<p>If you want to add it at startup, edit<strong> /etc/fstab</strong> in the following way :</p>
<pre lang="text">/dev/sda3       /home               ext3    defaults,acl 0       0</pre>
<p>Now take your favorite packages manager and set up ACL tools, which allow us to assign ACL to files. Mine will be :</p>
<pre lang="bash">$ apt-get install acl</pre>
<p>Now you can assign ACL using setfacl or consulting them using <strong>getfacl</strong>.<br />
Use <strong>man</strong> to get some precise examples of syntax.</p>
<p>Be advised of the following :<br />
&#8211; using <strong>cp</strong> with default does not preserve ACL. Use <strong>cp -a</strong>.<br />
&#8211; using <strong>mv</strong> always keep ACL.<br />
&#8211; in any case, if you copy/move files to a partition which is not mounted with ACL management (or with a file system that does not support it), ACL are lost.<br />
&#8211; <strong>ls -l</strong> gives an output with a &#8216;<strong>+</strong>&#8216;, that indicates that some ACL are presents. For more information, use <strong>getfacl</strong>.<br />
&#8211; KDE supports ACL in its interface, but Gnome does not yet. Maybe there is a <a href="http://rofi.pinchito.com/eiciel/">workaround</a>, but I haven&#8217;t tried yet.</p>
