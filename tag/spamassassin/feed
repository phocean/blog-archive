				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a mail server configuration based on <strong>Postfix</strong> for the smtp, <strong>Dovecot</strong> for the imap and virtual users receiving e-mails in maildir boxes.</p>
<p>I am also using <strong>Amavis</strong> and <strong>Spamassassin</strong> for content filtering.</p>
<p>I am not going now to describe this configuration, I think there are already a lot of very good tutorials about it all over the web. Moreover, the openSUSE maintainers made such a configuration quite easy : a sensible part of the work just consists in commenting out some line in the configuration files.</p>
<p>However, with the basic setup, I had an issue with permissions :Â  all e-mails delivered by Postfix were created with permissions set to 600.</p>
<p>A typical use case with which I got into trouble was spam learning, done with a cron script with a dedicated account (&#8220;vscan&#8221;, you don&#8217;t want to execute such a script with root, right ?).</p>
<p>In that case, what I need is files to be created with permissions 660.</p>
<p>It seems easy and rather obvious at first, but actually there is not such a setting in Postfix.</p>
<p>Actually, it is not really the job of the MTA to do it, so in the case of Postfix it doesn&#8217;t bother with the transmission of such a parameter.<br />
Then, I tried to use Procmail and set UMASK in <strong>/etc/procmailrc</strong>, but this just didn&#8217;t have any effect.</p>
<p>After searching and trying in vain a couple of hours, I found out that Dovecot can also deliver e-mails from the MTA to the maildir with Dovecot LDA.</p>
<p>So I tested it out. The configuration is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Add the line in bold to the virtual user configuration in <strong>/etc/postfix/main.cf</strong> :</p>
<pre>[...]
virtual_mailbox_domains = domain.com
virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/vmailbox
virtual_mailbox_base = /home/vmail
virtual_minimum_uid = 100
virtual_gid_maps = static:1002
virtual_uid_maps = static:1001
virtual_transport = dovecot
[...]</pre>
<p>Now, add these lines in <strong>/etc/postfix/master.cf</strong> :</p>
<pre>[...]
# Dovecot LDA
dovecot   unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
   flags=DRhu user=vmail argv=/usr/lib/dovecot/deliver -d ${recipient}
[...]</pre>
<p>Finally, configure <strong>/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf</strong> with these sections :</p>
<pre>[...]
protocol lda {
  # If you wish to use plugins you need to specify plugin directory
  # For example quota enforcing is implemented by plugin
  module_dir = /usr/lib/dovecot/modules/lda
  # Address from LDA should send MDNs like out of quota
  postmaster_address = postmaster@domain.com
  # UNIX socket path to master authentication server to find users.
  auth_socket_path = /var/run/dovecot/auth-master
}
[...]
auth default {
[...]
  socket listen {
	master {
		# Master socket provides access to userdb information. It's typically
		# used to give Dovecot's local delivery agent access to userdb so it
		# can find mailbox locations.
	      	path = /var/run/dovecot/auth-master
      		mode = 0660
		user = vmail
		group = vmail
	}
	client {
		# The client socket is generally safe to export to everyone. Typical use
		# is to export it to your SMTP server so it can do SMTP AUTH lookups
		# using it.
		path = /var/run/dovecot/auth-client
		mode = 0660
	}
  }
}
[...]</pre>
<p>And that&#8217;s all !<br />
Restart Postfix and Dovecot, check the log to ensure that everything works fine.<br />
Now all new mails should come out in the maildir folder with permissions set to 660.</p>
<p>Definitely, in my opinion, Dovecot LDA is the way to go : simple and extensible. Good bye Procmail and your cluttered configuration file.</p>
