				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dotclear 2 has been bêta for too long and I thought it was time to go over the limitations of a bêta version.</p>
<p>It seems that many people around have done that way and WordPress is so popular that I should consider to give a try to it.<span id="more-32"></span></p>
<p>For the migration, under Dotclear 2, I exported all the content into a flat text file.</p>
<p>Then, I installed WordPress : an extremely easy thing ! I have seen many php software easy to set up, but here it is just impressive. Great work&#8230;</p>
<p>Then I put the <a title="flatimport" href="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/flatimport.txt">flatimport</a> plug-in into the <strong>wp-admin/import </strong>folder, renaming it with a .php extension.</p>
<p>Finally, just go to the plug-in management interface of WordPress and import it ! That went smoothly for me, but still, as expected, the images were missing in my articles.</p>
<p>As both blogs and all my pictures were on the same server, I just needed to move the public directory of Dotclear (containing all images) to the wp-content/uploads folder.</p>
<p>If your pictures have miscellanous origins, don&#8217;t worry, there is a nice plug-in that very easely fetch all the image links of your blog and put the corresponding pictures into the WordPress folder. Look at <a title="Images to WordPress import" href="http://www.bloggingexpertise.com/plugins/cache-images/" target="_blank">there</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Importing to Worpdress" href="http://cvie.free.fr/public/tuto_dc2wp_en.html">On this page</a>, there are also more complete instructions in case you need.</p>
<p>After a few hours of use, I can already say that WordPress is an nice piece of software : it is very simple to use, but also very functional and aesthetic. So far, there is every thing I need.</p>
<p>The community looks also much bigger than Dotclear, which means a lot of plug-ins and additional functionalities. :)</p>
