				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently attended to the 2011 edition of the SSTIC conference (a major security conference in France), where I had a good time and where the <a title="Slides of Joanna Rutkowska" href="http://www.sstic.org/media/SSTIC2011/SSTIC-actes/ThoughtsonClientSystems/SSTIC2011-Slides-ThoughtsonClientSystems-rutkowska.pdf">slides of Joanna Rutkowska</a> somehow inspired me.</p>
<p>I shamelessly decided to reuse and extend her mind-map style diagram from a system security centric view into something more generic and operational on IT security.</p>
<p>Then, I came with this first version of the diagram:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Securing-Infrastructure.png" rel="lightbox[1125]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1138" title="Securing Infrastructure" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Securing-Infrastructure-small.png" alt="" width="600" height="341" /></a>A the moment it is probably quite incomplete and incoherent on some aspects, but I am quite satisfied of the shape it is taking. I will certainly update it quite often, as soon as I think about something new.</p>
<p>I find it convenient as a memo summarizing goals, steps and tools to achieve security. It may also help clarifying some points during a presentation.</p>
<p>Feel free to use it (as long as you keep the credit to this website). I am waiting for your comments and suggestions on how to improve it.</p>
