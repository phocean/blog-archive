				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomas Touceda advertised a new project on Full Disclosure.<br />
The idea sounds good, so I will keep an eye on this very interesting project.<br />
Though I would like to know more about the methods that were used for encryption and stenography.</p>
<p>Code and explanations are on the <a title="ESFS" href="https://github.com/chiiph/esfs" target="_blank">ESFS project homepage</a>.<br />
Beyond the pratical usage, I wonder if it can offer anyhow better resistance to statistical analysis that usually defeat stenography. The author addresses partialy the point on the mailing list:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I meant with hide is that, since it uses the LSBs, you can pick<br />
any image, and &#8220;find data&#8221; in them, so it makes it a little bit harder<br />
to know where you actually have data, and if you really do.</p></blockquote>
<p>To this, a reader named stormrider pointed out <a title="stenography attacks" href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/487-s06/westfeld-pfitzmann-ihw99.pdf" target="_blank">an interesting research document (PDF)</a>, which is a state of the art of the limitations of stenography and the attacks against it. Is it really a dead-end ?</p>
<p>This is indeed a very interesting field of research.</p>
