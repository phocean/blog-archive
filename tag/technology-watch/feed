				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been a big fan of the &#8220;<a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/archives/">Reducing the friction</a>&#8221; series of article published by <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe">Scott Lowe</a> a while back.</p>
<p>These articles consist in tips to automate or improve the smoothness of repeated professional tasks. If you haven&#8217;t, I recommend you to read them.</p>
<p>Some are specific to the Mac OS X environments, but most of time it is easy to find alternative stuff for Linux. By the way, I am thinking of sharing my own tips for Linux some day.</p>
<h2>The issues with technology watch</h2>
<p>Today, I will start with an article on how I tackled the issues I have with technology watching : too much information, too many sources, too much noise, too much time wasted&#8230; Hmm, yes, that&#8217;s a lot of issues!</p>
<p>Before, below are the sources that I used to visit plenty of times a day:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSS/Atom feeds, from <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a> with a few hundreds of sources.</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Reddit (most often /r/netsec, but also others)</li>
<li>Hacker News</li>
</ul>
<p>So my typical checks consisted in visiting these places subsequently, several times a day. With all the hassle of using different interfaces and the distractions that you can find there, it used to be very time costly and not really efficient.</p>
<p>Typically, I would save interesting topics there (&#8220;<em>like&#8221;</em> in Twitter, &#8220;<em>save</em>&#8221; for Feedly&#8230;) for a later check. Sometimes I would also use <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> to read them offline, or a simple PDF export.</p>
<p>As I already said, such a process with many tools is far from ideal and from the <em>Reduce the friction</em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> theory.</p>
<h2>Reducing the friction with Netvibes</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> is a Web platform allowing to gather many kinds of contents within dashboards. It is in fact possible to use it as a news aggregator like Feedly, but it has much more capabilities.</p>
<p>First, it can handle sources from various technologies or social media actors (at least, major ones are supported):</p>
<ul>
<li>RSS/Atom</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p>After adding some sources (they call them <em>applications</em>), you can get a classic feed view like below:</p>
<div id="attachment_2138" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2138" src="http://phocean.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-07-48-580x106.png" alt="Feed view on Netvibes" width="580" height="106" srcset="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-07-48-580x106.png 580w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-07-48-768x141.png 768w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-07-48-940x173.png 940w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-07-48-624x115.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Feed view on Netvibes</p></div>
<p>Nice! We now have a lot of stuff in one place and you can easily distinct what you have read or not (which is not easy to achieve in Twitter, for instance).</p>
<p>Then, similar to what <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> offers, you can create automated actions easily.</p>
<p>Here are some of the supported triggers:</p>
<div id="attachment_2137" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2137" src="http://phocean.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-10-57-59-580x256.png" alt="Services supported by Netvibes" width="580" height="256" srcset="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-10-57-59-580x256.png 580w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-10-57-59-768x340.png 768w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-10-57-59-940x416.png 940w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-10-57-59-624x276.png 624w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-10-57-59.png 1192w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Services supported by Netvibes</p></div>
<p>Based on a trigger like <em>marking</em> an article from within Netvibes, I can decide to send that article to Pocket or by e-mail for offline reading:</p>
<div id="attachment_2139" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2139" src="http://phocean.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-08-11-580x263.png" alt="Netvibes action" width="580" height="263" srcset="/blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-08-11-580x263.png 580w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-08-11-768x348.png 768w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-08-11-940x427.png 940w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-08-11-624x283.png 624w, /blog-archive/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Capture-décran-de-2016-11-27-09-08-11.png 1503w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Netvibes action</p></div>
<p>I have also another action: when a new post appears on a subreddit, I also send it to Pocket.</p>
<p>The possibilities, while not yet infinite, are huge.</p>
<p>You can do a lot with the free version, but for 2€ a month, you get content indexing to quickly find back some items in your feeds. I took this option, as it is useful but also as it is a way to support this project.</p>
<p>There is a premium offer, by far more expensive, but it is not really aimed to individual (analytics and collaborative features). See <a href="https://www.netvibes.com/fr/products">this page</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have tried, I believe, all possible alternatives. Including integrating Feedly with IFFT, which is nice but does not solve the issue of reading many sources.</p>
<p>Netvibes is so far very interesting and powerful. It is not perfect, however.</p>
<p>Sometimes the interface is a little clumsy or cumbersome. I also miss a mobile application (for Android), even though the mobile HTML 5 interface is not that bad (http://mobile.netvibes.com).</p>
<p>Finally, I could not find a way to republish a dashboard feed as RSS, so that I could use a mobile reader. Let&#8217;s hope that this powerful tool will continue to improve, and for that I hope it gains in popularity.</p>
